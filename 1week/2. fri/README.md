1. solving 2017 algorithm basic class's homework problem 3, 4
2. implement dijkstra algorithm using c++ or python language and understand this algorithm completely with heap operation
3. next algorithm is prim and kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm(but, until next monday, complete dijkstra and do prim only)

* on the weekly day, the schedule for regualar classes is very tough and heavy.  then, we append our group study on the wednesday lunch which is only discussing algorithm problem and solving it together for next meeting.
